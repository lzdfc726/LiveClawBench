# LiveClawBench Complexity Framework

This document is the single reference for task complexity annotations in LiveClawBench.
It covers factor definitions, the full 30-case annotation table (29 implemented + 1 planned),
summary statistics, domain coverage, and controlled pairs.

## Complexity Factor Definitions

LiveClawBench defines four orthogonal complexity factors that characterise the structural
sources of difficulty beyond baseline task execution:

- **A1 — Cross-Service Dependency**: The task requires coordinating across multiple
  independent services (e.g. email, airline, calendar) within a single workflow.
- **A2 — Contaminated Initial State**: The environment starts in a broken, incomplete,
  or corrupt state; the agent must diagnose and repair it before acting.
- **B1 — Implicit Goal Resolution**: The task goal is not stated explicitly; the agent
  must infer missing preconditions, seek clarification, or resolve implicit constraints.
- **B2 — Knowledge System Maintenance**: The task involves creating, updating, resolving
  conflicts in, or managing dependencies of a persistent skill/knowledge repository.

Cases with no factors serve as baselines: they measure basic execution ability in a
single, clean environment without structural complexity.

## 2. Factor Summary Statistics

| Factor | Description                    | Count | Percentage | Representative Cases                                          |
|--------|--------------------------------|------:|-----------:|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| A1     | Cross-Service Dependency       |    10 |      33.3% | flight-seat-selection, email-watch-shop, conflict-repair-acb  |
| A2     | Contaminated Initial State     |     6 |      20.0% | blog-site-completion-from-starter, vue-project-build-bug-fix-easy, noise-filtering |
| B1     | Implicit Goal Resolution       |     4 |      13.3% | flight-seat-selection-failed, flight-cancel-claim, flight-info-change-notice, baggage-tracking-application |
| B2     | Knowledge System Maintenance   |    11 |      36.7% | skill-creation, skill-dependency-fix, noise-filtering         |

> Percentages are relative to 30 total cases (29 implemented + 1 planned).

Factor combination distribution:

- No factors (baseline): 8 cases (26.7%) — email-writing, email-reply, flight-booking, blog-site-from-scratch, washer-shop, watch-shop, washer-change, info-change
- Single factor: 14 cases (46.7%)
- Dual factor: 7 cases (23.3%) — flight-seat-selection-failed (A1+B1), flight-cancel-claim (A1+B1), flight-info-change-notice (A1+B1), noise-filtering (A2+B2), incremental-update-ctp (A2+B2), mixed-tool-memory (A1+B2), live-web-research-sqlite-fts5 (A1+B2)
- Triple factor: 1 case (3.3%) — conflict-repair-acb (A1+A2+B2)
- **Multi-factor (≥2 factors): 8 cases (26.7%)**

## 3. Domain × Factor Heatmap

Factor occurrence frequency per primary domain:

| Primary Domain             | A1 | A2 | B1 | B2 | Total Factor Instances |
|----------------------------|----|----|----|----|-----------------------:|
| Documents & Knowledge      |  2 |  2 |  0 | 10 |                     14 |
| Communication & Email      |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |                      0 |
| E-commerce & Daily Svcs    |  5 |  0 |  2 |  0 |                      7 |
| Calendar & Task Mgmt       |  2 |  0 |  1 |  0 |                      3 |
| Coding & Software Dev      |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |                      1 |
| DevOps & Env Repair        |  0 |  2 |  0 |  0 |                      2 |
| Deep Research & Report     |  1 |  1 |  0 |  2 |                      4 |

Key observations:
- **B2 is highly concentrated in Documents & Knowledge** (10/11), reflecting the nature of knowledge management tasks
- **A1 is the most broadly distributed**, spanning 4 domains — cross-service coordination is a universal complexity source
- **B1 only appears in E-commerce and Calendar**, where tasks most naturally produce implicit goals
- **Communication & Email has no factors** — these cases serve as pure baselines

## 4. Controlled Pairs

LiveClawBench includes 5 controlled pairs for isolating single-factor effects on agent performance:

- **Factor-addition pairs**: the variant adds exactly one new complexity factor over the base
- **Intensity-gradient pairs**: both cases share the same factor, but at different depth/severity

| Pair ID | Controlled Pair                    | Base Case (Difficulty)              | Added Factor                | Variant Case (Difficulty)                |
|--------:|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|       1 | Shopping → Cross-env Shopping      | washer-shop (E)                     | +A1 (email integration)     | email-washer-change (E)                  |
|       2 | Shopping → Cross-env Shopping      | watch-shop (E)                      | +A1 (email integration)     | email-watch-shop (H)                     |
|       3 | Seat Selection → Failed Selection  | flight-seat-selection (E)           | +B1 (constraint failure)    | flight-seat-selection-failed (H)         |
|       4 | Vue Fix easy → hard                | vue-project-build-bug-fix-easy (H)  | +A2 (more complex faults)   | vue-project-build-bug-fix-hard (H)       |
|       5 | Skill Creation → Dependency Fix    | skill-creation (M)                  | +B2 (dependency chain)      | skill-dependency-fix (E)                 |

Pair design rationale:
- **Pairs 1–2** validate A1 (Cross-Service Dependency): Pair 1 shows no empirical difficulty change (E→E), while Pair 2 shows a large jump (E→H), suggesting the impact of cross-environment integration varies by workflow complexity
- **Pair 3** validates B1 (Implicit Goal Resolution): adding constraint failure to seat selection raises difficulty from E to H, confirming that autonomous fallback reasoning is empirically challenging
- **Pair 4** is an intensity gradient: both variants are empirically H — the granularity of empirical difficulty tiers does not distinguish the fault-chain depth difference
- **Pair 5** is an intensity gradient: empirically the variant (E) is easier than the base (M), suggesting agents find dependency-chain repair more tractable than open-ended skill creation

## 5. Difficulty Distribution

| Difficulty | Count | Percentage | Cases |
|:----------:|------:|-----------:|-------|
| Easy       |    18 |      60.0% | skill-conflict-resolution, skill-dependency-fix, skill-combination *(planned)*, email-writing, email-reply, flight-seat-selection, flight-info-change-notice, baggage-tracking-application, blog-site-from-scratch, blog-site-completion-from-starter, washer-shop, watch-shop, washer-change, info-change, email-washer-change, incremental-update-ctp, conflict-repair-acb, mixed-tool-memory |
| Medium     |     7 |      23.3% | skill-creation, skill-supplementation, skill-repository-curation, flight-booking, schedule-change-request, noise-filtering, live-web-research-sqlite-fts5 |
| Hard       |     5 |      16.7% | flight-seat-selection-failed, flight-cancel-claim, email-watch-shop, vue-project-build-bug-fix-easy, vue-project-build-bug-fix-hard |

Factor count vs difficulty:

| Difficulty | Avg Factor Count | Baseline (0 factors) | Single Factor | Multi-Factor |
|:----------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|
| Easy       |             0.89 |          7           |       7       |       4      |
| Medium     |             1.14 |          1           |       4       |       2      |
| Hard       |             1.40 |          0           |       3       |       2      |

The empirical reclassification (based on average solve rates across models) shows that Easy
cases dominate (60%). Easy cases include both baselines (38.9%) and factor-bearing tasks
(61.1%), indicating that many structural complexity factors do not pose significant difficulty
for current agents. Hard cases are concentrated in tasks requiring constraint failure handling
(B1) or specific challenging environments (A2 in DevOps).
