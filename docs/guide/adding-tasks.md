# Adding Tasks

This guide explains how to create a new benchmark task for LiveClawBench and submit it via pull request.

## Task Directory Structure

Create a directory under `tasks/<task-name>/` with the following layout:

```
tasks/<task-name>/
├── task.toml           # Required: metadata, timeouts, resource limits
├── instruction.md      # Required: agent-facing task description
├── environment/
│   └── Dockerfile      # Required: container build definition
├── solution/
│   └── solve.sh        # Oracle baseline: proves solvability + validates verifier logic
│                       # Run with --agent oracle; NOT executed during normal evaluation
└── tests/
    ├── test.sh         # Required: verification entry point (Harbor uploads this at runtime)
    └── verify.py       # Required: scoring logic
```

Naming: use `kebab-case` derived from the task's logical name (e.g., `flight-seat-selection`).

## Execution Lifecycle

Understanding when each task file runs helps you write correct Dockerfiles, startup scripts, and verifiers.

```
Stage 1  Container Build    Dockerfile → image (environment/Dockerfile)
Stage 2  Env Init           /entrypoint.sh → startup.sh (background) → sleep 5s → services ready
Stage 3  Agent Setup        Harbor writes LLM provider config to ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
Stage 4  Task Execution     openclaw agent --session-id harbor --message "<instruction.md content>"
Stage 5  Verifier Init      Harbor uploads tests/ into container, creates /logs/verifier/
Stage 6  Verification       bash /tests/test.sh → verify.py → writes reward.json + reward.txt
Stage 7  Result Collection  Harbor reads /logs/verifier/reward.txt, saves result.json
Stage 8  Cleanup            Container stopped and removed
```

File mapping:
- **Stage 1** → `environment/Dockerfile`
- **Stage 2** → `environment/entrypoint.sh` + `environment/startup.sh`
- **Stage 3** → Harbor OpenClaw adapter (automatic)
- **Stage 4** → agent reads `instruction.md` content
- **Stage 5–6** → `tests/test.sh` + `tests/verify.py`
- **`solution/solve.sh`** → only Stage 4 when `--agent oracle` is used; never runs in normal evaluation

> **Important:** The `tests/` directory is uploaded by Harbor at runtime — it is **not** baked into the container image. Do not rely on `tests/` being present during `docker build`.

## `task.toml` Field Reference

```toml
version = "1.0"

[metadata]
difficulty = "medium"          # easy | medium | hard
category = "open-world"
tags = ["e-commerce_daily_svcs", "communication_email"]

domain = "E-commerce & Daily Svcs"
domains_multi = ["E-commerce & Daily Svcs", "Communication & Email"]

# Triple-Axis Complexity Factors (0 = absent, 1 = present)
factor_a1 = 1   # A1: Cross-Service Dependency — task spans multiple services/APIs
factor_a2 = 0   # A2: Contaminated Initial State — pre-existing noise the agent must resolve
factor_b1 = 0   # B1: Implicit Goal Resolution — goal is underspecified; agent must infer intent
factor_b2 = 0   # B2: Knowledge System Maintenance — agent must persist or update structured knowledge

case_id = 99    # Unique integer across all tasks (check docs/metadata/cases_registry.csv)

[verifier]
timeout_sec = 900.0    # Max time for verify.py to run after the agent finishes

[agent]
timeout_sec = 1800.0   # Max time for the agent to complete the task

[environment]
build_timeout_sec = 600.0
cpus = 2
memory_mb = 4096
storage_mb = 10240
allow_internet = true  # REQUIRED for all OpenClaw tasks (agent calls LLM APIs)
```

> **Critical:** `allow_internet = true` is mandatory for any task where the agent uses its own LLM APIs inside the container (which is all OpenClaw tasks).

## Dockerfile Requirements

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:2026.3.11

# Install your task's dependencies
RUN apt-get install -y ...

# Copy environment files
COPY environment/ /task/environment/

# If your task has running services, start them via an entrypoint or startup script
```

- Base image: `ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:2026.3.11` (provides the OpenClaw agent runtime)
- For multi-service tasks: use a single `entrypoint.sh` that starts all services in the background and sleeps briefly before handing off to the main command
- Services are accessible to the agent at `localhost:<port>`

## `verify.py` Contract

### Output format

Harbor supports two parallel output files written by `test.sh`:

| File | Format | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| `/logs/verifier/reward.json` | Structured JSON | Recommended; contains sub-scores, judge rationale, model metadata |
| `/logs/verifier/reward.txt` | Plain scalar | Legacy; Harbor reads this for ranking |

**Recommended pattern: dual-write.** Write both files in every task. Harbor reads `reward.txt` for the final scalar; `reward.json` is preserved for post-hoc analysis and sub-dimension breakdowns.

`reward.json` schema (extend as needed):

```json
{
  "dimension_a": 0.75,
  "dimension_b": 1.0,
  "judge_rationales": {
    "dimension_a": "...",
    "dimension_b": "..."
  },
  "judge_model": "kimi-k2.5",
  "final_score": 0.875
}
```

`reward.txt` contains only the final scalar:

```
0.875
```

### Contracts

`verify.py` **must**:
1. Print a line matching `Score: X.X/1.0` (e.g. `Score: 1.0/1.0` or `Score: 0.5/1.0`)
2. Exit with code `0` if the score is ≥ 0.5 (pass threshold)
3. Exit with a non-zero code if the score is < 0.5

`test.sh` **must**:
1. Call `verify.py` (or equivalent scoring logic)
2. Write the scalar score to `/logs/verifier/reward.txt`
3. Optionally write structured results to `/logs/verifier/reward.json`

Scoring convention:
- `1.0` — task fully completed
- `0.5` — meaningful progress (partial credit)
- `0.0` — task failed

### Minimal verify.py example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Task verification script."""

def evaluate() -> float:
    # ... scoring logic ...
    return score

if __name__ == "__main__":
    score = evaluate()
    print(f"Score: {score:.1f}/1.0")
    import sys
    sys.exit(0 if score >= 0.5 else 1)
```

### Dual-write test.sh example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
mkdir -p /logs/verifier

SCORE=$(python3 /tests/verify.py 2>&1 | grep -oP 'Score:\s*\K[0-9.]+' | tail -1)
echo "$SCORE" > /logs/verifier/reward.txt

# Optional: write structured JSON alongside the scalar
python3 -c "
import json, sys
score = float('$SCORE')
result = {'final_score': score}
json.dump(result, open('/logs/verifier/reward.json', 'w'), indent=2)
"
echo "Verification score: $SCORE"
```

> **Note:** `reward.txt` is the legacy contract that Harbor currently uses for ranking. Future versions will migrate fully to `reward.json`. Writing both is recommended for forward compatibility.

## `solve.sh` — Oracle Baseline

`solution/solve.sh` has two purposes:

1. **Validates task solvability** — proves the task is solvable and that your `verify.py` logic is correct. Run it during task development to confirm `verify.py` gives a full score (1.0) on a working solution.
2. **Provides a reference solution** — used when running the oracle agent to establish a baseline score. The gap between oracle score and agent score quantifies difficulty.

`solve.sh` is **only executed** when `--agent oracle` is passed to `harbor run`. It does not run during normal evaluation with `-a openclaw`.

```bash
# Run oracle agent to validate your task and establish a baseline
harbor run -p tasks/<task-name> --agent oracle -n 1 -o jobs
```

## Validating Before Submission

Run the task validator to catch structural issues:

```bash
python scripts/validate_tasks.py
```

The validator checks:
- All required files are present
- Directory name matches `kebab-case` pattern
- `task.toml` has required fields (`version`, `difficulty`, `case_id`, `domain`, `allow_internet`)
- `case_id` is unique across all tasks
- Stub warnings: short `instruction.md`, echo-only `test.sh`, missing `solve.sh`

All 29 existing tasks must continue to pass.

## Submission Checklist

1. Create `tasks/<task-name>/` with all required files
2. Set `allow_internet = true` in `task.toml` under `[environment]`
3. Assign a unique `case_id` (check `docs/metadata/cases_registry.csv`)
4. Add an entry to `registry.json`
5. Add a row to `docs/metadata/cases_registry.csv`
6. Run `python scripts/validate_tasks.py` — all tasks must pass
7. Fork the repo and create a branch: `task/<task-name>`
8. Open a pull request with a brief description of the task

## Known Pitfalls

**Service startup race conditions**
If your Dockerfile starts background services, add a `sleep` in the entrypoint before signaling readiness. The standard pattern is a 5-second sleep in `startup.sh` before the agent begins.

**case_id conflicts**
Always check `docs/metadata/cases_registry.csv` before choosing a `case_id`. The validator will catch duplicates, but resolving conflicts after the fact is disruptive.
