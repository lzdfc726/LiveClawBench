Thanks for the detailed analysis on the microservices architecture. I've reviewed your suggestions and I think we should proceed with the following approach:

  body: `Hi Peter,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am Lau from Parrot AI, and I believe that we have spent a wonderful time discussing about our co-operation in the past few weeks.

As we are currently scaling our Generative TTS (Text-to-Speech) models to support more emotive and context-aware voice cloning, we are looking for a strategic partner to provide a customized dataset. Specifically, we would like to focus on the following requirements:
- Multi-Scenario Emotional Range: We require approximately 200 hours of high-fidelity recordings (48kHz, 24-bit) that cover specific emotional spectrums, including "professional/empathetic," "high-energy/promotional," and "conversational/casual."
- Diverse Speaker Profiles: We are looking for a balanced mix of 50+ unique voice identities across various age groups (20s to 60s) and specific regional accents (e.g., North American, British, and Australian English).
- Detailed Metadata Tagging: To optimize our training pipeline, each audio clip needs to be accompanied by precise transcriptions and time-aligned emotion/stress labels.
- Ethical Compliance: Since we prioritize AI ethics, we require full documentation ensuring that all contributors have provided explicit consent for their voices to be used in AI model training.

I would love to schedule a brief call next week to discuss your current capacity for such a project and explore how we can align our technical roadmaps.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
