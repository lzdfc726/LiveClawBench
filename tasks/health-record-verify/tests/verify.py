    Mitigates the race where the verifier runs before the mock service has
    finished schema bootstrap (Issue #108 §2.3).

    On timeout: prints a WARNING with diagnostic info (parent-dir listing)
    and RETURNS. We don't raise SystemExit because that would short-circuit
    the verifier and turn a "DB late" condition into a hard 0 — observed
    regression in pr_audit/results/pr2/social-schedule-audit (0.40 → 0.0).
    The downstream sqlite3.connect() will surface a normal OperationalError
    if the file truly does not exist, which the verifier's per-anomaly
    try/except will score as 0 for that dimension only.
