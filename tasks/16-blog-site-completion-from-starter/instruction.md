## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Database Schema

**Tables Required:**
- `posts` - Blog posts with title, slug, content, status (draft/published/archived), author_id, view_count, created_at, updated_at, published_at

- `posts_fts` - FTS5 virtual table for full-text search on posts

**Database Configuration:**
- Enable WAL mode for better concurrency
- Enable foreign key constraints (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`)
- Foreign key relationships must be defined and enforced
- FTS5 sync triggers for posts (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### 4.2 Authentication System

- Signed with configurable JWT_SECRET from environment
- Expired tokens rejected
- Tokens validated on protected routes

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- Three roles: `admin`, `editor`, `user`
- Admin: Full system access
- Editor: Can manage all posts, access admin dashboard
- User: Can only manage own content, access user dashboard

### 4.3 User Dashboard

**Post Management:**
- Users see only their own posts (ownership filter)
- Create posts with draft or published status
- Edit own posts only
- Delete own posts only
- Accurate post counts per user
- Permission enforcement: users cannot edit/delete others' posts

**Profile Management:**
- Update display name
- Update bio
- Update avatar URL
- Update website URL
- Partial updates allowed
- Changes persist correctly

**Public Author Profiles:**
- Public URL: `/author/[username]`
- Display bio and avatar
- Show only published posts (drafts hidden)
- Accurate published post count
- Publicly accessible without authentication

### 4.4 Post Visibility Rules

**Draft Posts:**
- Visible to author in dashboard
- Hidden from public blog index
- Direct public access returns 404
- Author can view own drafts in dashboard

**Published Posts:**
- Visible in public blog index
- Visible on author profile
- Searchable via FTS5
- Included in RSS feed

**Archived Posts:**
- Hidden from public
- Visible to author in dashboard
- Direct public access returns 404
- Not included in search or RSS

### 4.5 Permission System

**Ownership Model:**
- All posts have `author_id` referencing users table
- Foreign key constraint enforced

**Edit Permissions:**
- Users: Can edit only their own posts
- Editors: Can edit all posts
- Admins: Can edit all posts

**Delete Permissions:**
- Users: Can delete only their own posts
- Editors: Can delete all posts
- Admins: Can delete all posts

**Enforcement:**
- Non-owners attempting edit/delete are denied
- Failed delete attempts leave post in database
- Permission checks on all post operations

### 4.6 Search Functionality

**Full-Text Search:**
- FTS5 virtual table on posts (title, content)
- Search returns ranked results
- Only published posts searchable
- Fast keyword search across all posts

### 4.7 RSS Feed

**Feed Generation:**
- Valid XML format
- RSS channel with required elements
- Each post as `<item>` with title, link, pubDate
- Only published posts included
- Sorted by publication date (newest first)
- Available at `/rss.xml` or `/feed.xml`

### 4.8 SEO Metadata

**Dynamic Meta Tags:**
- Page title includes post title
- Meta description from post excerpt
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Different metadata per post

### 4.9 System Settings

**Configuration Management:**
- Settings stored in key-value pairs
- Timestamps track when settings changed
- Settings persist across application restarts
- Support for blog title, description, etc.

**Environment Variables:**
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret for signing JWT tokens
