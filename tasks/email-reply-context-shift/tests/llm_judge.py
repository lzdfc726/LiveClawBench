"""Verifier for email-reply-context-shift (C1).

Checks: final sent email acknowledges the meeting cancellation.

Scoring:
  - When JUDGE_BASE_URL is set and the judge call succeeds, return the
    judge's 0.0-1.0 score + write per-dimension breakdown to reward.json.
  - When JUDGE_BASE_URL is set but the call fails (network outage, model
    rejected, etc.), the retry loop exhausts and the verifier emits 0.0
    with `_meta_judge_failed=1`. (Was previously a silent 0; PR-5 makes
    the failure mode explicit so downstream stats can filter judge errors
    out of agent-skill aggregates.)
  - When JUDGE_BASE_URL is unset (offline / no-credentials run), fall back
    to the deterministic heuristic scorer.
